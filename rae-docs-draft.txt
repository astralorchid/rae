1-1. Types
	Rae uses primitive types in a similar fashion to x86 assembly. Most data is read as raw binary, however the compiler will determine signs in numeric literal expressions. It is up to the user to determine how the data is expressed and processed. Type keywords consist of the following:
	byte - 8-bit binary value
	word - 16-bit value
	dword - 32-bit value
	qword - 64-bit value

1-2 Variables
	Variable identifiers must be alphanumeric and can use underscores and hypens. The first character of the identifier cannot be numerical or a hypen.

1-2.1 Variable Declaring, Initialization, and Assignment
	Variable declarations must include a type keyword before the identifier separated by whitespace.

	Variables can be intialized in their declaration using a single equal sign after the identifier. On the right side of the equal sign, the user can use literals, variable/preprocessor identifiers and expressions using binary operators.

	All declarations, initializations, and assignments must end with a semicolon.
